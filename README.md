# Go Get Nuts

**Play it at http://owenou.com/go-get-nuts**.

The basic idea of the game is you control a [Gopher](https://golang.org) to collect nuts and avoid bombs.
This is a HTML5 game that should work everywhere, including on desktops, phones and tablets.

I built the game to experiment with [Phaserjs](https://phaser.io).
Note that the game is a slight modification to the example from the book [Discover Phaser](https://www.discoverphaser.com).
